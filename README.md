<h1>Test website to showcase my portfolios</h1>
<h3>Built using Vite and classic html css js</h3>
<h3>Animated with Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP)</h3>
_I'm trying to experiment with motion graphics using GSAP because of the wide array of features and super active forums, all while being so easy to set up_

<h2>New Features</h2>
Currently only has button and color streaks around it
next plan is to actually introduce the transition after you click the button.




<h6>_credit to gemini that helps with planning out the algorithms and understanding how the mechanics work in GSAP, summarizing the forums into readable form_</h6>
